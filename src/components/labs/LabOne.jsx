<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 30 years since Motorola developed, "the bone," which boasted a talk time of 30 minutes, was approved for market. The device was approximately a foot long and weighed around eight times  more than the devices we use now (Films Media Group,2015). The history of mobile phones is what has brought us to the present and also into the future. All of which can only be fully understood by starting from the beginning and working forward. <br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Past: 1980 â€“ 2006</strong><br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of a cellphone production began in 1984 when Motorola introduced the first "commercial handheld cellular phone," the DynaTAC 800X, nicknamed "the brick." Phones remained bulky for quite some time, But by the 90s, they had lost some weight. Flip phones that could be carried in a pocket became the norm. Still, the other format was I'm much thinner- a more minor variation of its predecessor. In 2002 cameraphones dominated the market, and this added functionality increased consumer consumption (Boston Globe, 2014). Both the flip phone and the camera phones were sought by the younger generation, who began to popularize the use of texting.<br/><br/>
<strong>Present: Post-2008</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007 Apple released the first iPhone, a little bulky compared to modern devices but much closer in design (Boston Globe, 2014). The device featured a touch screen, replacing the previously commonplace dial pad buttons. New functionalities included a Music player, web browsing, games, a personal calendar and many more. Smartphone. The new format has coined the smartphone, creating a unique niche within the mobile phone market.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smartphone innovation continues to grow today with the addition of other technologies, and functionality from installable applications (Rhoads, 2005). They have become the modern replacements for PDA devices. Many computing activities can be completed on the pocket-sized device in the palm of your hand.
<br/><br/>
<strong >Future</strong><br/>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile phone innovations continue to; we are at one time communicating across distances, which Was only seen in movies and TV shows such as Star Trek. <br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future possesses unlimited possibilities for innovation and the development of mobile phones. Some technologies, such as AI, virtual reality, and augmented reality, are just a few Of the results from the minds of engineers. Each possesses the possibility of further development within its own niche and possible extension through sci-fi technologies. This includes ideas such as brainwave control, gesture control, and even holograms (Films Media Goup, 2015). Additional engineering and refinement are needed for these. Still, they are possible future components in the next generation of mobile phones.
